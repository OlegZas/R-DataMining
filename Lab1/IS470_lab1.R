#### Overview of R and RStudio--------------------------------------------------

#R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. 
#R provides a wide variety of statistical methods for data mining and modeling, 
#such as linear and nonlinear regression, classical statistical tests, 
#time-series analysis, classification, clustering and association rule mining.

#RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It includes a 
#console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as 
#well as tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management.

#### Basic operators and data structures in R-------------------------------------
# You are required to complete all the tasks by following the lab video. 
# Please name your R script as Lab1_FirstLastName.R, and submit on BeachBoard.

# 1. Assignment operator


# 2. Use the colon (:) operator to create integer sequences.



#Vector: The fundamental R data structure is the vector, which stores an ordered 
#set of values called elements. A vector can contain any number of elements, but 
#all of the elements must be of the same type of values. For instance, a vector 
#cannot contain both numbers and text. vectors can be created by using the c() 
#combine function.

# 3. Create vectors 


# 4. Obtain the body temperature for patient Jane Doe 


# 5. A range of values can be obtained using the (:) colon operator


# 6. Exclude Jane Doe's temperature data 


#Factor: A factor is a special case of vector that is solely used to represent 
#categorical variables.

# 7. Create a factor from a character vector 


# 8. Create a factor for the blood type 



#Data frames: A structure analogous to a spreadsheet or database, since it has 
#both rows and columns of data. 

# 9. Create a data frame for our patient dataset, by using the patient data vectors we created.


# 10.	Obtain the subject_name vector from the created data frame.


# 11.	Extract the first and second columns from the data frame.


# 12.	Extract the value in the first row and second column of the patient data frame. 


# 13.	Extract the first column from data frame.


# 14.	Extract the first row from data frame.


# 15.	Extract everything from data frame.


# 16.	Exclude the first column from data frame.


# 17.	Exclude the first row from data frame.
